abpackingangle
==============

This is code based on Abhi Raghavan's packing angle program to
calculate the VH/VL domain packing angle as described in:

Abhinandan, K.R. and Martin, A.C.R. (2010) 'Analysis and Prediction of
VH/VL Packing in Antibodies', Protein Engineering Design and Selection,
23, 689-697.

Compiling the program requires a copy of
